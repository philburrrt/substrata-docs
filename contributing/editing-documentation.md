# Editing Documentation

Substrata community documentation is hosted on a public Github repo that is actively maintained. Any may add, remove or modify copy in the documentation, which is found in the [docs](https://github.com/philburrrt/substrata-docs/tree/main/docs) folder. If the change is urgent, go to [discord](https://discord.gg/hzyYZEcU) and notify someone so an admin of the repo can prioritize the pull request

## How to edit docs through Github (for noobs)

All modification can be done through the Github user interface. All you need is an account, and the ability to click a few buttons.

1. Go to the [docs](https://github.com/philburrrt/substrata-docs/tree/main/docs) folder on Github. Here you will find where the markdown (.md) files are stored. Markdown files all correspond with a page in the documentation.

    #### Markdown TLDR
    These are basically text files with a bit of extra syntax to help format the copy. You can find a TLDR on writing in markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). It's best to draft your markdown copy on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) as they include nice-to-have features like drag-and-dropping image files that are auto-hosted and auto-generate a link. After you've finished the draft, it will be ready to copy paste into the Github UI.

1. Find the file you would like to edit

1. Commit changes

- Type a title for your change and a short description if necessary. Committing changes will fork the repository and create a branch specifically for the changes you are committing.

1. Submit pull request

- This is essentially asking the admins of the repo to accept the changes in the fork that you just created by 'committing changes'

You can use this same approach to create new pages, but not delete them. In order to add a new page, simply click the 'Add file' dropdown and choose 'Create new file'.

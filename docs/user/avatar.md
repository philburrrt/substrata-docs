# Avatars

Substrata currently supports avatars from:

- Any VRM (.vrm) avatar. 
- .gltf or .glb avatars. 

These avatar files need to follow one of a few naming bone naming conventions (e.g. Ready Player Me, VRM, or RPM schemes). Avatars also need to be in 'T pose'.

Find user made avatars for free on sites like:
    - [VRoidHub](https://hub.vroid.com/en/)
    - [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/search?q=tag%3Avrm&sort_by=-likeCount&type=models)
    - [Ready Player Me](https://substrata.readyplayer.me/)

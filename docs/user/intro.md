## Build and explore for free

You *do not* need to own land to experience Substrata's capabilities. Here's some things you can do to get a feel for the application: 
- Test out building and scripting in your multiplayer enabled Personal World which currently supports up to 15gb of storage.
- Equip an avatar, fly around the map and explore what has already been built. Your avatar will carry with you across personal and public instances

## Purchasing Parcels

When a new district is released, a maximum of 9 parcels are auctioned every day at 12:00 am UTC until they run out. Substrata currently utilizes a [dutch auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp#:~:text=A%20Dutch%20auction%20is%20a,terms%20of%20quantity%20and%20price.)

View live auctions on [substrata.info](https://substrata.info/parcel_auction_list) and find more details about the price schedule.

### How to pay 

You can choose to pay either with cryptocurency, paypal or a credit card.

Paying with cryptocurrency through Coinbase does not require a Coinbase account. By clicking on any of the cryptocurrencies below the 'pay with coinbase' button, you can purchase directly through the corresponding crypto wallet. 

**Example**: clicking 'Ethereum' opens MetaMask if it is installed

### Minting an NFT 

By default, purchasing a parcel **does not** mint an NFT. If you would like your minted, there are two steps to do so:
1. On your account page, find the link that says 'Link an Ethereum address and prove you own it by signing a message' and complete the process.
2. Find the parcel in your account and click 'mint NFT'. This is done manually and can take anywhere up to 24 hours.

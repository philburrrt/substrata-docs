## Build and explore for free

You *do not* need to own land to experience Substrata's capabilities. Here's some things you can do to get a feel for the application: 
- Test out building and scripting in your multiplayer enabled Personal World which currently supports up to 15gb of storage.
- Equip an avatar, fly around the map and explore what has already been built. Your avatar will carry with you across personal and public instances

## Purchasing Parcels

When a new district is released, a maximum of 9 parcels are auctioned every day at 12:00 am UTC until they run out. Substrata currently utilizes a [dutch auction](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchauction.asp#:~:text=A%20Dutch%20auction%20is%20a,terms%20of%20quantity%20and%20price.)

View live auctions on [substrata.info](https://substrata.info/parcel_auction_list) and find more details about the price schedule.

### How to pay 

You can choose to pay either with cryptocurency, paypal or a credit card.

Paying with cryptocurrency through Coinbase does not require a Coinbase account. By clicking on any of the cryptocurrencies below the 'pay with coinbase' button, you can purchase directly through the corresponding crypto wallet. 

**Example**: clicking 'Ethereum' opens MetaMask if it is installed

### Minting an NFT 

By default, purchasing a parcel **does not** mint an NFT. If you would like your minted, there are two steps to do so:
1. On your account page, find the link that says 'Link an Ethereum address and prove you own it by signing a message' and complete the process.
2. Find the parcel in your account and click 'mint NFT'. This is done manually and can take anywhere up to 24 hours.

### Purchasing a parcel on the secondary market ###
Finally, you have the option of purchasing an already-minted parcel from the secondary market on [Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/substrata-parcel). Note parcels on the secondary market tend to be more expensive than buying them directly from the Substrata.info website.

If you purchase an NFT on Opensea, you will then need to claim ownership of the NFT on the Substrata.info website.

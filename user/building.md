# How to Build

If you have some [3d models](./objects.md), then you won't necessarily need to 'build' anything. Though, if you would like to do so from scratch, you can use the integrated building system.

You can use voxels to build structures.

Click CTRL + left mouse button at the same time to duplicate your voxel and attach it to any side of the original. Similarly, click ALT + left mouse button at the same time to reduce the size of your duplicated voxel.

And if you want to manipulate the size of your voxel, edit the 'Scale x/y/z' metric in the 'Editor' window. You can also do things like rotate, skin and color, or script an object through this window.
